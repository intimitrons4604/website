# Website

There are currently two parallel versions of the website.

- The legacy PHP site and API (i.e. the current public facing website and contact API used by the new site) are in the `legacy` directory and documented [there](legacy/)
- The new website is in the `next` directory and documented [there](next/)

If your changes need to be publicly visible, edit the legacy site. If your changes only concern the next site, make them there. **If you make changes to site content that exists in both sites, ensure you make the changes in both sites so that the content is not different when we switch to the new site.**
